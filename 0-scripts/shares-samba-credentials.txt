Securely store credentials in /etc/fstab:

Instead of putting username= and password= directly in the fstab options, use the 
credentials= option to point to your new secure file. e.g. instead of this:

//192.168.1.29/d /mnt/win-d cifs username=myuser,password=xxxx1234,vers=3.1.1,uid=0,gid=0,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755 0 0

You would change it to:

//192.168.1.29/d /mnt/win-d cifs credentials=/etc/samba/share-win-d.cred,vers=3.1.1,uid=0,gid=0,file_mode=0755,dir_mode=0755 0 0

The file can be anywhere, but to be secure, we put it somewhere that only root can access it:

/etc/samba/share-win-d.cred tials directory first).
username=myuser
password=xxxx1234

If you need to specify a domain, add a domain line
domain=your_domain_or_workgroup

Set Secure Permissions:
This is crucial. Only root should be able to read (and write) this file.
sudo chown root:root /etc/samba/share-win-d.cred
sudo chmod 600 /etc/samba/share-win-d.cred

chmod 600 ensures that only the owner (root) has read and write permissions, and no one else
(including groups or other users) can access it. Some recommend chmod 400 (read-only for root)
if you don't anticipate the file being modified programmatically.

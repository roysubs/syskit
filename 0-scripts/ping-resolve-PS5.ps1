.SYNOPSIS
    Pings a range of IP addresses and resolves hostnames for active IPs.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script first uses 'ping-iprange.ps1' to identify active IP addresses
    within a specified start and end range. For each active IP address found,
    it then attempts to perform a reverse DNS lookup to determine its hostname.
    The results, showing IP addresses and their resolved hostnames, are displayed
    in a table.
    If run without parameters, this help message is displayed.

.PARAMETER StartAddress
    The starting IP address of the range to scan. This is mandatory for operation.

.PARAMETER EndAddress
    The ending IP address of the range to scan. This is mandatory for operation.

.PARAMETER PingScriptPath
    The path to the 'ping-iprange.ps1' script. Defaults to './ping-iprange.ps1'
    (assuming it's in the same directory as this script).

.PARAMETER Help
    Displays this help message.

.EXAMPLE
    ./resolve-iprange.ps1 -StartAddress 192.168.1.1 -EndAddress 192.168.1.10

    IP           Hostname
    --           --------
    192.168.1.1  router.local
    192.168.1.5  fileserver.local
    192.168.1.7  N/A (Resolution Failed)

    This example scans IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.10, pings them,
    and then tries to resolve hostnames for those that respond.

.EXAMPLE
    ./resolve-iprange.ps1 -Help

    Displays this help message.

.EXAMPLE
    ./resolve-iprange.ps1

    Displays this help message because no parameters were provided.

.NOTES
    Relies on the 'ping-iprange.ps1' script for the initial ping sweep.
    Ensure 'ping-iprange.ps1' is executable and its path is correct.
    DNS resolution can be slow if many hosts are found or DNS servers are unresponsive.

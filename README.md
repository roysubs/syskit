syskit Bootstrap Project
=========================

---

‚ñ∂ Purpose: A reusable, modular bootstrap layer for any Linux system running bash.

---

The `syskit` repo can rapidly bootstrap any Linux system:

  ‚Ä¢ Run `source ./update-bashrc-vimrc-paths.sh` in the root of `syskit`.

  ‚Ä¢ Essential `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`, and`.inputrc` configuration (all idempotent and non-invasive).

  ‚Ä¢ Menu guided new system setup to get up and running fast.

  ‚Ä¢ Scripted idempotent Docker logic with sane defaults to start many projects in seconds

  ‚Ä¢ Git integration with SSH and clean setup scripts to connect to GitHub

  ‚Ä¢ Help system for many aspects of Linux and common applications

  ‚Ä¢ Deploying clean, powerful, and easy to use helper scripts: `a`, `b`, `def`, `dk`, `g`, `h`, `z`, etc

  ‚Ä¢ 

Bootstrap Process
=========================

 1. üèÅ Initial Setup

    ‚Ä¢ Custom .bashrc setup provides the very useful h and def functions
    ‚Ä¢ Ensures required tools are installed: curl, git, vim, mdcat, etc (wip)
    ‚Ä¢ Ensures Bash and Readline behave consistently across sessions
    ‚Ä¢ Adds 0-scripts to PATH for access to core scripts: a, b, d, f, g, z, dk, etc

 2. üêö .bashrc and Shell Environment

    ‚Ä¢ Adds aliases, functions, and helper logic cleanly
    ‚Ä¢ Idempotent: avoids duplication if .bashrc already contains a block
    ‚Ä¢ Preserves any existing user logic

3. üéØ .inputrc and Navigation
    - Adds readline keybindings:
        - `Ctrl-k/j`: Vim-style up/down history
        - `Ctrl-Backspace`: Delete previous word
        - `Ctrl-Home` / `Ctrl-End`: Jump to start/end of line
    - Detects terminal quirks (e.g. tmux) and avoids all keybinding conflicts

4. üîß Wrapper Scripts to make essential tools more accessible
    - `h` in .bashrc: Custom history manager with fuzzy search, timestamps, grep, and rerun
    - `def` in .bashrc: See definitions of functions, aliases, shell commands
    - `a`: Auto wrapper for app packaging (e.g. apt, apk, dnf, zypper, etc (wip: AppImage, pipx, Nix, brew?)
    - `dk`: Wrapper for `docker`, provides a lot of useful shortcuts
    - `g`: Git wrapper for common workflows, push protection, old-version retrieval
    - `z`: Smart archive tool: extract/compress across formats

5. üê≥ Docker Environment
    - Checks for Docker/Docker Compose, installs if missing
    - Ensures proper permissions (adds user to docker group)
    - `dk-monitor.py`: real-time stats + I/O + sampling
    - Adds pre-deploy safety logic:
        - Detects port conflicts
        - Detects already-running containers using same image
        - Warns if containers with the same names exist
        - Fully idempotent: safe to re-run bootstrap anytime

6. üß† Git Setup
    - `g acp`: Add/commit/push with optional gitleaks scan
    - `g pl`: Pull with inspection, backup, and diff before merge (wip)
    - SSH setup helper: generates SSH key, prints copy-paste GitHub instructions
    - `.gitconfig` customization with sane diff, log, and push defaults

7. üíæ Vim Setup
    - Creates a well-commented `.vimrc`, with no overriding of core vim keybindings
    - Sets these up in both `vim` and `nvim` (`neovim`)
    - `h-vim` help file explains usage, visual modes, and power tips

8. üìÅ Config Layout
    - `~/syskit/`, `~/syskit/0-scriptsbin/`, and `~/.config/`  
    - Project-local `.env` and `config.sh` conventions supported  
    - Standard layout:  
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/syskit/              ‚Üê project root  
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/syskit/0-new-system  ‚Üê new system essentials  
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/syskit/0-scripts     ‚Üê Main body of scripts  
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/syskit/0-docker      ‚Üê Container setup scripts  
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ~/syskit/0-help        ‚Üê Custom help files  

---

Re-running bootstrap
=========================
üåÄ Fully Idempotent:  
    - Script detects and skips existing entries in `.bashrc`, `.inputrc`, etc  
    - Will never break your shell or duplicate entries  
    - If rerun, will:  
        - Print summary of what it would do  
        - Ask for confirmation before overwriting anything  
        - Offer `diff` style output of any proposed changes  

---

Optional Add-ons
=========================

‚úÖ Media-Stack containers (qBittorrent / Sonarr / Radarr)  
    - Manage as a single container stack  
    - Uses `wireguard` VPN container (significantly lower footprint than OpenVPN)  
    - Media folder paths standardized under `/mnt/media` via bind mount  
    - Media config paths standardized under `~/.config/media-stack`  
    - Generic Wireguard setup with work with any VPN vendor  

‚úÖ Backup, Sync, and Sharing integration  
    - rsync, rclone, and borgbackup scripts available (wip)  
    - Syncthing as local or container install  
    - Filebrowser for web UI access to `media-stack`  

‚úÖ Monitoring Container Stack  
    - `monitoring-stack` : grafana + prometheus instannt setup  
    - CPU, mem, network, and container states

# New Linux System Setup Scripts

Essential tools to add to any Debian/Mint/Ubuntu system to cleanly add functionality, and particularly useful for new environments to get up and running quickly. There is no need to run every script; just pick and choose as required from each section.
The main menu script `setup-new-system-by-menu.py` (if available in the project root) can help automate the installation of multiple scripts. Some phases also contain their own menu-driven Python scripts.

The `0-new-system/0-wip` directory may contain work-in-progress scripts that are not yet finalized for general use.

## Phase 0: Initial System Configuration (new0-*)

These scripts perform foundational setup tasks. Run them first, especially on a new system.

* `new0-apt-update-upgrade-autoremove.sh`: Updates package lists, upgrades installed packages, and removes unused packages. Essential first step.
* `new0-debian-original-setup-tasks.sh`: Script for Debian original setup tasks. *(Purpose needs to be further defined based on script content)*.
* `new0-disable-gnome-power-settings.sh`: Disables GNOME's default power management settings (e.g., suspend) which can be problematic for servers.
* `new0-disable-power-settings.sh`: A more general script to disable system power-saving features (e.g., suspend, lid close actions) for headless or always-on systems.
* `new0-fix-debian-repos.sh`: Corrects Debian repository sources. (Note: May become redundant with newer Debian releases).
* `new0-fstab-nofail.sh`: Modifies `/etc/fstab` entries to include the `nofail` option, preventing boot issues if listed volumes are temporarily unavailable.
* `new0-openssh-server-setup.sh`: Installs and configures the OpenSSH server, enabling remote access (SSH) to the system.
* `new0-sudo-add-current-user.sh`: Adds the current user to the `sudo` group, granting administrative privileges.
* `new0-sudo-set-timeout-24-hours.sh`: Extends the `sudo` password timeout to 24 hours, reducing frequent password prompts for privileged operations.
* `new0-sync-clock-to-Amsterdam.sh`: Synchronizes the system clock with a time server, setting the timezone to Amsterdam.
* `new0-sync-clock-to-London.sh`: Synchronizes the system clock with a time server, setting the timezone to London.
* `new0-timeshift.sh`: Installs and configures Timeshift for system snapshot creation and restoration. Important to setup quickly and take an initial snapshot to roll back to in case of issues.

## Phase 1: User Environment and Core Tools (new1-*)

Scripts for setting up the user's environment, shell customizations, and essential system utilities.

* `new1-add-paths.sh`: Adds custom directories to the system's or user's `PATH` environment variable for easier command execution. *(Consider renaming to be more specific if it adds particular paths, e.g., `new1-add-custom-scripts-to-path.sh`)*.
* `new1-bashrc.sh`: Configures the `.bashrc` file with custom aliases, functions, and settings for the Bash shell in a non-disruptive way.
* `new1-inputrc-key-bindings.sh`: Customizes readline key bindings in `/etc/inputrc` or `~/.inputrc` for enhanced command-line editing.
* `new1-inputrc-tab-completion.sh`: Enhances bash tab completion settings via `inputrc` for more efficient command input.
* `new1-update-h-scripts.sh`: Updates a specific set of scripts, possibly helper scripts or scripts from another source referred to as "h-scripts". *(Clarify what "h-scripts" are for better understanding)*.
* `new1-vimrc.sh`: Sets up a custom `.vimrc` for Vim (and potentially Neovim) with preferred settings and plugins in a non-disruptive manner.

## Phase 2: Applications, Services & Development Tools (new2-*)

Installation and configuration of various applications, services, and development-related packages.

* `new2-clamav.sh`: Installs and configures ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine.
* `new2-dev-package-managers.sh`: Installs various package managers for different programming languages (e.g., Yarn, Pipx, Cargo, Composer, Maven, Gradle, CPAN, Homebrew, Miniconda, cabal, Go).
* `new2-essential-apps-by-menu.py`: A Python script providing a menu to install essential applications.
* `new2-essential-devtools-by-menu.py`: A Python script providing a menu to install essential development tools.
* `new2-ssh-keygen.sh`: Generates SSH key pairs for the user, typically for passwordless authentication to other systems.
* `new2-tailscale.sh`: Installs and configures Tailscale, a VPN service for creating secure networks.
* `new2-vnc.sh`: Sets up a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server for remote graphical desktop access.
* `new2-x11-forwarding.sh`: Configures SSH X11 forwarding to allow running graphical applications remotely.
* `new2-xrdp.sh`: Sets up XRDP (an open-source Remote Desktop Protocol server, enabling remote desktop access from RDP clients), and troubleshooting.

## Phase 3: Advanced Tools & Automation (new3-*)

Scripts for more specialized tools, automation, and specific software stacks.

* `new3-ansible.sh`: Installs Ansible, the IT automation tool.
* `new3-ansible-example.yml`: An example Ansible playbook, demonstrating how to use Ansible for configuration management or deployment.
* `new3-email-with-gmail-relay.sh`: Installs and configures a local mail server with Postfix to relay emails through a Gmail account for sending console/system emails.
* `new3-powershell-pwsh-debian.sh`: Installs PowerShell (pwsh) on Debian-based systems.
* `new3-powershell-pwsh-ubuntu-mint.sh`: Installs PowerShell (pwsh) on Ubuntu/Mint systems.

## Phase 4: Personalization (new4-*)

Scripts for user-specific personalizations.

* `new4-bashrc_personal.sh`: Configures personal `.bashrc` additions. An optional script to manage user specific aliases, functions, or settings unique to a user's preference.

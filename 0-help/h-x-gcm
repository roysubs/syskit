# Troubleshooting and Fixing Git Credential Manager (GCM) Issues

## Overview
If Git keeps prompting for your Personal Access Token (PAT) even though you're using Git Credential Manager (GCM), it may indicate that GCM is not properly saving your credentials. Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

---

## 1. **Check Credential Manager Configuration**
Ensure that GCM is set up as the credential helper for Git.

Run the following command:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper
Expected Output: manager-core or manager.
If the output is not manager-core, set it explicitly:
bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
2. Verify the Token Is Saved
After entering your PAT during a git push, ensure that it was saved by GCM.

Run:   `git credential-manager-core list`
Expected Output: An entry for github.com should appear.
If no entry exists, GCM has not saved your credentials.

3. Inspect the Git Configuration
Verify that the URL for your GitHub repository is correct.

Run:   `git remote -v`
Expected Output:
```php
https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
```

If the remote URL looks correct and you're still having issues, consider switching to SSH for better authentication management:
`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo>.git`
You'll need to set up an SSH key if you haven't already.
4. Clear and Re-enter Credentials
If your credentials are not being saved properly, you might need to clear them and re-enter them.

Clear existing credentials:

bash
Copy code
git credential-manager-core erase
Then, try pushing again. GCM should prompt you to enter your credentials, which will be saved.

5. Check GCM Installation
Ensure that GCM is properly installed.

Run:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install git-credential-manager-core
If GCM is already installed, this will confirm that the latest version is present.
6. Use an Alternative Credential Helper (Optional)
If GCM continues to fail, you can use a simpler credential helper like store. This stores credentials in plain text (less secure but simple).

Set the credential helper to store:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
The next time you enter the PAT, it will be saved in ~/.git-credentials.
7. Enable Debug Logs
To better understand why GCM isn't saving your credentials, enable debug logging.

Run:

bash
Copy code
GIT_TRACE=1 GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git push
Review the logs to determine where GCM fails to save or load the credentials.
8. Fix Multiple Values for credential.helper
If you've encountered an error like this:

bash
Copy code
error: cannot overwrite multiple values with a single value
It means you have multiple values set for credential.helper.

Step-by-Step Fix:
Inspect Current Configuration: Run:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --get-all credential.helper
Expected Output: Multiple helpers may be listed, e.g.:
bash
Copy code
/usr/local/bin/git-credential-manager
manager-core
Remove Existing Values: Run:

bash
Copy code
git config --global --unset-all credential.helper
Set the Correct Helper: After clearing all existing values, set the correct credential helper:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
Verify the Change: Confirm that only one value is set:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper
Expected Output: manager-core
Conclusion
Following these steps should resolve issues with GCM prompting for your PAT repeatedly. If the problem persists, ensure that your GitHub credentials are correct and that GCM is properly installed and configured.

# RuneQuest 2 Combat Process Cheatsheet

## Combat Sequence

1. **Declare Intentions**:
   - Each player declares what their character intends to do during the round.

2. **Determine Initiative**:
   - Roll for initiative to determine the order of actions.
   - Typically, DEX ranks are used to resolve actions.
   
3. **Movement**:
   - Characters move according to their movement rates.
   - Movement can be a walk, run, or charge.

4. **Actions**:
   - Characters perform their actions, such as attacking, casting spells, or other maneuvers.

## Attack Procedure

### Roll to Hit

Roll percentage dice against the character's weapon skill.
- **Success**: If the roll is equal to or less than the skill, the attack hits.
- **Special**: If the roll is equal to or less than 1/5th of the skill, it's a special hit.
- **Critical**: If the roll is equal to or less than 1/20th of the skill, it's a critical hit.
- **Fumble**: If the roll is above 96% or other specific conditions, it's a fumble.

### Hit Table

| Roll   | Result      |
|--------|-------------|
| <= Skill%      | Normal Hit  |
| <= Skill%/5    | Special Hit |
| <= Skill%/20   | Critical Hit|
| 96-00 | Fumble      |

### Defense Roll

The defender may choose to:
- **Parry**: Roll against the weapon's parry skill.
- **Dodge**: Roll against the character's dodge skill.

### Damage Resolution

1. **Roll for Damage**:
   - Roll the damage dice for the weapon used.
   - Add any relevant modifiers for strength, skill, etc.

2. **Subtract Armor**:
   - Subtract the target's armor points for the hit location from the damage rolled.
   - The remaining damage is applied to the hit location.

3. **Apply Damage**:
   - Deduct the final damage from the hit points of the target's hit location.

### Hit Location Table

| d20 Roll | Location    |
|----------|-------------|
| 1-3      | Left Leg    |
| 4-6      | Right Leg   |
| 7-9      | Abdomen     |
| 10-12    | Chest       |
| 13-15    | Left Arm    |
| 16-18    | Right Arm   |
| 19-20    | Head        |

### Example of an Attack

1. **Player**: "I attack the troll with my broadsword!"
2. **DM**: "Roll to hit."
3. **Player**: Rolls d100 and gets 45, which is a hit (weapon skill is 60%).
4. **DM**: "Roll for damage."
5. **Player**: Rolls 1d8+1d4 for damage and gets 10.
6. **DM**: Subtracts the troll's armor (3) from the damage. "The troll takes 7 points of damage."

### Damage and Healing

1. **Hit Points**: 
   - Each hit location has its own hit points.
   - When a location's hit points reach zero, it becomes incapacitated.
   
2. **Major Wounds**:
   - If a location takes damage equal to or greater than its hit points, it may be severed or rendered unusable.

3. **Healing**:
   - Natural healing: Characters heal 1 hit point per location per week of rest.
   - Magical healing: Spells and potions can restore hit points more quickly.

### Example of Damage Application

1. **Player**: "I attack the goblin with my axe!"
2. **DM**: "Roll to hit."
3. **Player**: Rolls d100 and gets 15, which is a special hit (weapon skill is 75%, special hit threshold is 15).
4. **DM**: "Roll for damage."
5. **Player**: Rolls 1d6+2 for damage and gets 6. Adds 6 for special hit damage = 12.
6. **DM**: Subtracts the goblin's armor (2) from the damage. "The goblin takes 10 points of damage to its right arm."

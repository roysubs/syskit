# Unattended Upgrades Cheatsheet

## Introduction
`unattended-upgrades` is a package that automatically installs security
and other updates on Debian-based systems without requiring user
interaction.

## Installation

### Install `unattended-upgrades`
- To install the package, run:
`sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`
- Enabling unattended-upgrades
- Once installed, enable it to automatically install security updates:
`sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades`
- Configuring unattended-upgrades
The main configuration file for unattended-upgrades is:
`sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
By default, unattended-upgrades is configured to install only security updates. To customize this, you can modify the Allowed-Origins section.
Example configuration to allow automatic updates for all packages (not just security updates):
```bash
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {
    "Debian stable";
    "Debian stable-updates";
    "Debian security";
};
```
- Enable Automatic Updates
To configure automatic package list updates and automatic installation of updates, edit the auto-upgrades file:
`sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades`
Add or modify the following lines to enable automatic updates and upgrade:
```bash
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";  # Update package lists every day
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";    # Install unattended upgrades every day
```
### How It Works
The system automatically installs security updates and other updates depending on the configuration, without requiring user input.
If the configuration is set to update the package list and perform upgrades daily, this process will occur at the specified intervals.
- Checking the Log and Status
To see if unattended-upgrades is working correctly, you can check its log:
`cat /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades.log`
This will show the updates that have been installed automatically.

### Example Log Output
The log will contain entries like:

```bash
3019-12-04 10:02:57,678 INFO Starting unattended-upgrades version 1.1
3019-12-04 10:02:57,678 INFO Allowed origins are:
  "Debian stable"
  "Debian security"
3019-12-04 10:02:57,678 INFO No packages found that can be upgraded unattended
```

- Troubleshooting
To check if unattended-upgrades is actively running:
`systemctl status unattended-upgrades`
  - Manual Run
If you'd like to manually trigger unattended-upgrades to run:
`sudo unattended-upgrade --dry-run  # Check what would be upgraded`
`sudo unattended-upgrade            # Perform upgrades`
  - Configuring Email Alerts
To receive email alerts about the upgrades, you can configure unattended-upgrades to send email notifications. Ensure that your system is set up to send mail (e.g., using msmtp or postfix).
To enable email notifications:
`sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
```bash
Unattended-Upgrade::Mail "root";
Unattended-Upgrade::MailOnlyOnError "true";
```

- Changing the Default Log Location
If you prefer to log to a different file, change the log location in the configuration:
`sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
`Unattended-Upgrade::LogDir "/var/log/unattended-upgrades";`

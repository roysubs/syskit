MATE is enabled by default on Debian with MATE.

Ensure SSH is Active: Before you make these changes, ensure SSH is running to maintain remote access:

To stop all graphiacal services to have a console only state to save resources, you can stop the display manager and related graphical services. Ensure SSH is Active before you make these changes, to maintain remote access:
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   sudo systemctl enable ssh

- Identify the Display Manager: MATE typically uses lightdm, but it could be another display manager like gdm3 or sddm. Use ps and look for the name of the running display manager:
   ps aux | grep dm

- Stop the Display Manager with systemctl (replace lightdm with the display manager). This will terminate the graphical interface.
   sudo systemctl stop lightdm   

- Prevent the Display Manager from Restarting at the next boot:
   sudo systemctl disable lightdm

- Switch to Multi-User Target (a non-graphical runlevel multi-user.target) thatâ€™s designed for a console-only environment:
   sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
   sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target   # Switches to console-only immediately

Reverting to Graphical Mode:

- If you need to return to the graphical interface, you can start the display manager manually or switch the default target back:
   sudo systemctl start lightdm
   sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
   sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target

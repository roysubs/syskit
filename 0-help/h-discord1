Discord Quick Notes
===============

- **Install Discord**:
    - For Debian-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu):
      - Download the `.deb` package from [Discord's website](https://discord.com/download) and install with: `sudo dpkg -i discord.deb`
      - Or use Snap: `sudo snap install discord`
    - For Red Hat-based systems (e.g., Fedora):
      - Download the `.rpm` package from [Discord's website](https://discord.com/download) and install with: `sudo rpm -i discord.rpm`

- **Run Discord**:
    - From terminal: `discord`
    - Or find it in the applications menu.

- **Set Up Your Discord Account**:
    - Launch Discord and log in with your account.
    - If you don't have an account, you can register directly within the app.

- **Navigating the Discord Interface**:
    - **Servers**: The left sidebar lists all servers you're a member of.
    - **Channels**: Inside each server, channels are listed under categories. Click on a text or voice channel to join.
    - **Direct Messages**: Click on the Home icon to access DMs.
    - **User Settings**: Click the gear icon near your profile name to access settings like notification preferences, appearance, and keybinds.

- **Voice and Video Calls**:
    - To join a voice channel, click on any voice channel in a server.
    - Use the camera icon to start a video call in a voice channel.
    - Use the microphone icon to mute/unmute yourself.

- **Discord Shortcuts**:
    - `Ctrl+K`: Quick switch between servers and channels.
    - `Ctrl+Shift+M`: Mute/unmute your microphone.
    - `Ctrl+Shift+D`: Turn on/off your webcam.
    - `Ctrl+/`: Open help menu for keybinds.

- **Customizing Discord**:
    - **Themes**: Go to **User Settings > Appearance** to select a light or dark theme.
    - **Notifications**: Go to **User Settings > Notifications** to customize sound, alerts, and notifications for servers and DMs.
    - **Keybinds**: Go to **User Settings > Keybinds** to set custom shortcuts for various actions (mute, push-to-talk, etc.).

- **Discord Bots**:
    - Bots can be added to servers to automate tasks (e.g., music bots, moderation bots).
    - Add a bot by inviting it via its website (e.g., for a music bot: `https://top.gg/`).
    - Once added, configure it using the appropriate commands (e.g., `!help` for most bots).

- **Troubleshooting**:
    - **No sound**: Ensure your audio settings are correctly configured in **User Settings > Voice & Video**.
    - **Frozen app**: Try restarting Discord or clearing the cache: `rm -r ~/.discord/` (Discord will rebuild it upon restart).
    - **Can't join voice channels**: Check if your microphone is properly configured and Discord has permission to access it.

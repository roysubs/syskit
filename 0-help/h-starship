Starship Quick Notes
====================

Uninstalling Starship and Reverting to Normal Bash Prompt
========================================================
1. **Remove Starship**:  
     ```bash
     # Via package managers
     sudo apt remove starship / cargo uninstall starship / brew uninstall starship 
     ```
   - Starship configuration is typically located at `~/.config/starship.toml`.
     To remove Starship configuration: `rm ~/.config/starship.toml`  
   - Revert to default Bash Prompt: Open `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` if using that)
     Remove the Starship initialization line: `eval "$(starship init bash)"`
   - Apply the changes by reloading .bashrc: `source ~/.bashrc`

Starship Features and Customization
===================================

- **What is Starship?**
  - Starship is a minimal, fast, and customizable prompt for any shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.) that provides a dynamic, feature-rich, and visually appealing prompt.
  - Designed for speed and customization with a focus on developer-friendly features.

- **Installation**:
  - Install Starship using:
    ```bash
    # Via cargo (Rust package manager):
    cargo install starship
    
    # Via package manager (apt or brew):
    sudo apt install starship   # Or brew install starship
    ```

- **Basic Configuration**:
  - Starship reads configuration from `~/.config/starship.toml`. The file contains settings for how your prompt will look and behave.
  - Example of a simple configuration:
    ```toml
    # ~/.config/starship.toml
    [character]
    symbol = "❯"
    style = "bold green"
    ```

- **Prompt Customization**:
  - You can customize what appears in your prompt by modifying `starship.toml`. For example:
    - **Time**:
      ```toml
      [time]
      format = "[$time]($style) "
      style = "bold yellow"
      ```
    - **Git Status**:
      ```toml
      [git_status]
      format = "([\($branch\) $state])"
      style = "bold blue"
      ```

- **Other Shell Integrations**:
  - Starship supports many shells, including Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, and Elvish. You just need to initialize it by adding the appropriate line to the shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

- **Features**:
  - **Fast and lightweight**: Designed to be minimal and responsive, even for users with large codebases.
  - **Highly customizable**: A flexible configuration file allows you to easily adjust the appearance, modules, and behavior of the prompt.
  - **Git integration**: Displays detailed Git information such as the branch name, status, and changes in the prompt.
  - **Support for multiple languages and tools**: Offers built-in support for many development tools, such as Python, Node.js, Rust, Docker, and more.

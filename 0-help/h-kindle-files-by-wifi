# Kindle File Management via WiFi

This guide is for managing files on a Kindle when USB port is still damaged, still charging, but data transfer is broken.
This will allow copying a `.mobi` file to the Kindle or to delete files from it over WiFi.

## Prerequisites
- Your Kindle and computer are on the same WiFi network.
- Access to your Kindle's email address (used for "Send to Kindle").
- An email account approved in your Kindle's settings.
- A basic understanding of Kindle's file management via email.

---

## 1. **Setting Up Email for "Send to Kindle"**

1. **Find Your Kindle Email Address**:
   - On the Kindle, go to **Settings** > **Device Options** > **Personalize Your Kindle** > **Send-to-Kindle Email**.
   - Note down the email address (e.g., `yourname@kindle.com`).

2. **Add an Approved Email Address**:
   - Visit [Amazon's Manage Your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mycd).
   - Navigate to **Preferences** > **Personal Document Settings**.
   - Under **Approved Personal Document E-mail List**, add your email address.

---

## 2. **Sending a `.mobi` File to Your Kindle**

1. Open your email client.
2. Compose a new email:
   - **To**: Your Kindle email address.
   - **Subject**: Leave blank or type anything (it doesn’t matter).
   - **Attachment**: Attach the `.mobi` file.
3. Send the email.

4. On your Kindle:
   - Ensure it is connected to WiFi.
   - Sync your Kindle by tapping **Settings** > **Sync Your Kindle**.
   - The `.mobi` file should appear in your library.

## 3. **Deleting a File from Your Kindle**

If you cannot access your Kindle over USB, use these methods to delete files:

### A. Delete from Kindle Directly:
1. Open your Kindle library.
2. Long-press the file you want to delete.
3. Select **Remove Download** (if synced with Amazon) or **Delete This Book** (if sideloaded).

### B. Remove Files via Amazon Account:
1. Go to [Manage Your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mycd).
2. Locate the file under **Your Content**.
3. Select it and click **Delete**.

---

## 4. **Troubleshooting**

### File Doesn't Appear:
- Ensure the file format is supported by Kindle (`.mobi`, `.azw3`, etc.).
- Verify your Kindle is synced and connected to WiFi.

### File Can't Be Deleted:
- Restart your Kindle and try again.
- If the file remains, it may be corrupted—resetting the Kindle may help (back up files first).

---

## Conclusion

Using the "Send to Kindle" feature via email is a reliable alternative to USB file transfer. For file deletions, the Kindle interface or Amazon’s management tools provide viable solutions.

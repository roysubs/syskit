Remove Flatpak Completely: If you don’t plan to use it at all, you can uninstall Flatpak:
sudo systemctl stop flatpak-system-helper.service
sudo systemctl disable flatpak-system-helper.service
sudo apt remove flatpak
sudo apt autoremove

Alternatives to Flatpak
If you’re looking for lightweight package management, stick with APT or AppImage.

APT: Native Debian package management is the most efficient and lightweight.

AppImage: Portable, self-contained application bundles that don’t require daemons or services (as Snap and Flatpak do). They don’t integrate with the system as smoothly as Flatpak but avoid background resource usage entirely.

# YouCompleteMe for Vim

This is a guide to up the **YouCompleteMe** programming autocompletion plugin for **Vim** with installation steps, usage instructions, and how to disable or uninstall the plugin if needed.

## Step 1: Install vim-plug

First, install the `vim-plug` plugin manager if you haven't already. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

## Step 2: Update .vimrc

Once `vim-plug` is installed, edit your `.vimrc` file to include the following configuration for `YouCompleteMe`:

```vim
" Initialize vim-plug
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" Install YouCompleteMe
Plug 'ycm-core/YouCompleteMe'

" End plugin section
call plug#end()
```

Save the `.vimrc` file.

## Step 3: Install the Plugin

After updating your `.vimrc`, open Vim and run the following command to install the plugin:

```vim
:PlugInstall
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

YouCompleteMe requires some additional dependencies to work. Install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-dev
```

Then, navigate to the plugin directory and compile YouCompleteMe:

```bash
cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --all --no-go
```

This installs without 'go' support. If that is wanted, go must be installed (~250 MB)

```bash
sudo apt install golang-go
mkdir ~/go-modules
cd ~/go-modules
go mod init example.com/gocode
go install github.com/nsf/gocode@latest
export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
# source ~/.bashrc  # If adding to PATH in .bashrc or ~/.zshrc, remember to source afterwards
gocode -h
cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --all
```

## Step 5: Restart Vim

After the installation is complete, restart Vim. You should now have autocompletion with YouCompleteMe!

## Using YouCompleteMe

- **Completion**: As you type, YouCompleteMe will suggest completions. Press `Tab` to cycle through the suggestions.
- **Manual Trigger**: You can trigger completion manually by pressing `Ctrl-Space`.

## Disabling or Uninstalling YouCompleteMe

If you no longer need the plugin, you can disable or uninstall it as follows:

### 1. Disable YouCompleteMe Temporarily

To temporarily disable the plugin without removing it completely, you can comment out the `Plug` line in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
" Plug 'ycm-core/YouCompleteMe'
```

Then, restart Vim.

### 2. Uninstall YouCompleteMe

To fully uninstall the plugin, follow these steps:

1. Open `.vimrc` and remove or comment out the line that includes `YouCompleteMe`:
   ```vim
   " Plug 'ycm-core/YouCompleteMe'
   ```

2. Run the following command in Vim to remove the plugin:
   ```vim
   :PlugClean
   ```

3. Optionally, remove the YouCompleteMe directory from `~/.vim/plugged`:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe
   ```

### 3. Clean Up Dependencies

If you no longer need the dependencies installed for YouCompleteMe, you can remove them using:

```bash
sudo apt remove build-essential cmake python3-dev
```

## Conclusion

You've now successfully set up, used, and learned how to uninstall the YouCompleteMe plugin in Vim. If you need to re-enable it, simply follow the steps to add it back into your `.vimrc` and run `:PlugInstall` again.

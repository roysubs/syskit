# Cheat Quick Notes

## Basics

cheat is a console app that comes with a very set of plain text cheatseats for frequently used commands. It also allows users to create, view, and manage these and their own additions to these. Its purpose is to provide quick access to reminders and examples of command syntax and options directly from the terminal, saving you from having to remember complex man pages or search online documentation repeatedly.

### Installation

Installation:
```bash
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/cheat/cheat/releases/download/4.4.0/cheat-linux-amd64.gz
gunzip cheat-linux-amd64.gz
chmod +x cheat-linux-amd64
sudo mv cheat-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cheat
```

### Updating Cheat Sheets
Update all available cheat sheets:
```bash
cheat -u
```

### Custom Cheat Sheets
- To create your own cheat sheets that won't be overwritten when updating:
  1. Create a custom folder for your cheat sheets, e.g., `~/.cheat`:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.cheat
     ```
  2. Add your custom folder to the `CHEAT_PATHS` environment variable in your shell config (e.g., `~/.bashrc`):
     ```bash
     export CHEAT_PATHS="~/.cheat:/path/to/default/cheats"
     ```
  3. Reload your shell configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

### Color Support
Cheat supports colorized output. To enable it, set the `CHEAT_COLORS` environment variable:
```bash
export CHEAT_COLORS=true
```
Add the above line to your shell configuration for persistent settings.

## Tips and Tricks

- **Offline Mode**:
  - Cheat works offline as all sheets are stored locally.

- **Preview Markdown**:
  - Use `glow` to preview Markdown files:
    ```bash
    glow <file>
    ```

- **Default Editor**:
  - Set a default editor for creating or editing cheat sheets by defining the `EDITOR` variable in your shell config:
    ```bash
    export EDITOR=nano
    ```

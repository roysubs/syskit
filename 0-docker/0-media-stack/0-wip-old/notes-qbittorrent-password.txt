qBittorrent Web UI issue seen where torrents will disappear after a short time (only browser refresh
will show them again). Web UI worked perfectly in Incognito Mode, so if regular mode breaks after
refresh → persistent stale cache or script conflict (frontend JavaScript or cached asset problem).
✅ Solution: Hard Cache Wipe + Extension Check:
- Clear all cached files for the Web UI domain, as browsers often don’t purge service workers,
indexedDB, or cached JS/CSS, even on Ctrl+F5.
For Chrome/Edge/Brave: Open the Web UI in the browser → F12 DevTools → Application tab.
In the left sidebar: select Storage → check all boxes → click 'Clear site data'
Then go to the Network tab → check 'Disable cache' (top bar)
Reload the page with Ctrl+Shift+R
- Disable all browser extensions. Some ad blockers, script filters (like uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger,
Ghostery), or even password managers can break SPA-style UIs like qBittorrent. Try temporarily disabling
all extensions, then reload the page. If it works, re-enable extensions one at a time to find the culprit.
- Use a Dedicated Browser Profile Create a separate browser profile or bookmark it to
launch in incognito (if persistent login isn't needed) or use a lightweight browser just for managing your
torrent stack.

To show qbittorrent's WebUI password in logs:
docker logs qbittorrent 2>/dev/null | grep temporary | awk '{print $16}'

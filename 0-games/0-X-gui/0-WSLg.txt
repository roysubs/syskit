Notes on Running Games via WSLg
WSLg supports hardware-accelerated OpenGL, so most 2D and 3D games from the apt repository should run smoothly, especially on systems with a compatible GPU and up-to-date drivers.

To install any of these games, simply open your WSL terminal and use the sudo apt install command as shown above.

Some games may require additional dependencies or tweaks for best performance, but most will work out of the box with WSLg.

These games are all free, open-source, and readily available from the standard Ubuntu/Debian repositories, making them easy to install and play on your WSLg setup.

Telehack is a telnet-based simulation of a 1980s-style computer network, mimicking the feel of old-school hacking
and BBS systems. It includes a mix of retro Unix commands, old files from ARPANET and Usenet, little Easter eggs,
and fun commands like star wars that trigger ASCII art animations (like the famous ASCII Star Wars movie originally
made by Simon Jansen).

How to Use Telehack on Linux

🔧 Step-by-step:
Connect to Telehack via telnet:
telnet telehack.com

If you don’t have telnet installed, you can install it:
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install telnet
Fedora:        sudo dnf install telnet
Arch:          sudo pacman -S inetutils

Once connected, you'll see a retro-style prompt. Try typing:
star wars

This usually plays the ASCII Star Wars animation (or something similar). If it doesn’t work, you can also try:
telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl

That’s the direct Star Wars ASCII movie.

🧠 Other Telehack actions:
Type help to see available commands.
Use commands like ls, cat, grep, finger, and more.
Try hacker, adventure, or messages for retro goodies.
You can even explore a pseudo-ARPANET with netmap and connect to old-style "hosts".

Let's go full retro hacker mode. Here's your guided tour through the best of Telehack—like you're living inside WarGames or Hackers.

🧠 1. Basic Command Mastery
Once you're connected (telnet telehack.com), try getting comfy with:

help        # see the command index
who         # who's online right now
fortune     # get a random quote or Unix joke
editor      # launches a tiny old-school text editor
If you want to explore the file system like it’s 1983:

ls          # list files
cd /        # go to root
cd /doc     # ARPANET files and internet history
cd /bbs     # old Bulletin Board System stuff
cat file.txt  # view a file
Try:

cat arpanet-history.txt
cat hacker.txt
cat welcome.msg

🌐 2. ARPANET Explorer
See the full fictional net with:
netmap
Use arrow keys or WASD to move around. Highlighted hosts can be connected to:
connect [hostname]
Once inside a host, try:
ls
cat notes.txt

💡Some hosts have secrets or files like /etc/passwd. Try:
cat /etc/passwd

💻 3. Hack the Planet
Telehack lets you play as a faux-hacker with commands like:
scan       # find vulnerable hosts
hack [host]  # attempt to hack a host
hack all     # try mass-hacking everything
It’s like a puzzle mini-game — some hosts are protected, some give rewards or access to extra areas.

🎮 4. Play Retro Games
Classics from the early PC era:
adventure     # Colossal Cave Adventure
star trek     # An old-school text-based strategy game
tron          # ASCII lightcycle game
hacker        # Retro hacker simulation game

💻 5. Visual Fun & ASCII Art
ASCII-based time-wasters and fun:
star wars          # ASCII version of the movie (sometimes redirect to towel.blinkenlights.nl)
matrix             # Text rain from The Matrix
life               # Conway’s Game of Life
figlet Hello!      # Huge ASCII letters
ascii              # List ASCII art you can view
cat /ascii/*.txt   # See what's in the collection

Try:
cat /ascii/darth.txt
cat /ascii/dragon.txt
cat /ascii/skull.txt
🕵️ 6. Spy Files & Nerdy Gems

Read vintage files from /doc or /bbs. A few bangers:
cd /doc
cat hacker-ethics.txt
cat hacker-dictionary.txt
cat arpanet-jargon.txt

Or from /bbs:
cd /bbs/phrack
cat phrack-1.txt
You’ll find fake “leaks,” newsletters, and the old-school vibe of BBS users trolling each other in pure ASCII.

🛠️ 7. Do Some Light Sysadmining
Explore what it felt like to be a sysop in the '80s:

cat /etc/passwd         # See old-style Unix user list
cat /etc/motd           # Message of the Day
ps                      # Show processes
kill [pid]              # (fake) kill a process

Sometimes you’ll find user files like ~/mail, ~/notes.txt, or .plan files. Check:
cd /users
ls
cd alice
cat notes.txt

🎯 Bonus Challenge: Find the Hidden Goodies
You’re a digital archaeologist now. Try searching:
grep -i password /doc/*
grep -i nuke /doc/*
grep -i aliens /doc/*
You never know what you’ll dig up—fake logs, conspiracy texts, hacker manifestos.

🧙 Want the Ultimate Nerd Move?
Open a CRT-style terminal emulator (like Cool Retro Term).
Fire up Telehack in full screen.
Put on some ambient synthwave or WarGames soundtrack.
Type: hacker
Now you're living in the '80s.

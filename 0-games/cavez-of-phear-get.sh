How to play
==========
Cursor keys to move (or 2-4-8-6 keypad keys).
b to place and t to detonate bomb.
w to highlight position. s to toggle sound on/off.
==========

To open a specific level:
phear /usr/share/phear/data/levels/02
The only levels available now in that folder are:
01  02  03  04  05  06  07  08  09  10  11

By picking up a diamond * you get 10 points, picking up money $ gives
you 100 points. You get one extra life for every 1000 points you score.

Move around with the arrow keys or the 2-4-8-6 keys. Press k to commit
suicide if you should get stuck.

Got the bombs (%)? Great! Press b to place them, and t to detonate them
all at once. Note that the bombs you place will act just like stones,
affected by gravity, rolling, and so on..

Watch out for monsters (M) -- if they catch you, you will die. To fight
back, drop stones on them or blow them up using your bombs.

Pressing s will enable/disable sound, w will highlight your current position.

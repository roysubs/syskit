### Notes
- **Containerization**: Most of these games are lightweight and can be run in a terminal without containerization. If you need a specific game containerized (e.g., in Docker), here’s an example Dockerfile for *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*:
```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cataclysm-dda
CMD ["cataclysm"]
```
You can adapt this for other games by installing their dependencies.

- **Availability**: Many of these games are open-source and available on GitHub or package managers like `apt` or `brew`. Some, like *Zork* or *Planetfall*, can be played via emulators like `Frotz`.

- **Why 50?**: The terminal game ecosystem is niche, and while I’ve reached 50 by including both modern roguelikes and classic text adventures, some may border on the retro style you wanted to avoid. I’ve prioritized quality and engagement to meet your criteria.

- **Running the Games**: Most can be installed on Linux/macOS/Windows with a terminal emulator. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead* with `sudo apt install cataclysm-dda`.

If you need help setting up any specific game or want a containerized version of one, let me know, and I can provide detailed instructions or a custom Dockerfile.

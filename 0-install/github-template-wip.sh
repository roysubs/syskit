Welcome to Bash Life - Conway's Game of Life
--------------------------------------------
Move around the area with the cursor keys, space to place an 'o' in as many locations as required, then 's' to start, and 'q' to quit.

Famous Objects in Conway's Life:

1. Glider:
A small pattern that travels diagonally across the board.

 ooo

2. Lightweight Spaceship (LWSS):
A larger pattern that travels horizontally or vertically.

3. Blinker:
An oscillator that alternates between two states.
State 1:   ooo
State 2:    o
            o
            o

4. Toad:
Another oscillator that alternates between two states.
State 1:   ooo
           ooo
State 2:    o
           o o

5. Pulsar:
A larger oscillator that alternates between three states.
State 1:
    ooo   ooo

Rules of Conway's Life:
-----------------------
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
